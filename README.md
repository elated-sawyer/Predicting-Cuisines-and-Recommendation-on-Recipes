# Predicting-Cuisines-and-Recommendation-on-Recipes
Course Project in “Data Mining and Exploration”

There are three sections of code in our project: 
Section1 EDA, the file name is 'section1_EDA.ipynb'
Section2 cuisine prediction, the file name is 'section2_Cuisine_prediction.ipynb'
Section3 collaborative filtering corresponds to the part2, part3, and part4 in our report respectively. And the files are 'cf_module.py' and 'section3_CF.py'.
(The supporting functions for section3 are included in cf_module.py.)


**instructions**:

- Put the data under '042'
- Setup a python3 virtual env and install the following packages:
	* Scipy:  1.5.4
	* Numpy:  1.19.5
	* Pandas 1.1.5
	* Matplotlib:  3.3.4
	* seaborn 0.10.0
	* sklearn: 0.24.1
	* xgboost 1.19.2

**For Section1 EDA and Section2 cuisine prediction**:
- Start a server and run the notebooks 'section1_EDA.ipynb' and 'section2_Cuisine_prediction.ipynb'
- View the results in the notebook and the generated files in '042'

**For section3 collaborative filtering**:
- Make sure that section3_CF.py, cf_module.py and the datafile recipes.csv are in the same folder. 
- Run section3_CF.py, who will import functions from cf_module.py.
- The results can be seen by checking the corresponding variable in the environment.

"**DME_Report.pdf**" is the final report, and its LaTeX source code is all included in the report folder.
