There are three sections of code in our project: 
Section1 EDA, the file name is 'section1_EDA.ipynb'
Section2 cuisine prediction, the file name is 'section2_Cuisine_prediction.ipynb'
Section3 collaborative filtering corresponds to the part2, part3, and part4 in our report respectively. And the files are 'cf_module.py' and 'section3_CF.py'.
(The supporting functions for section3 are included in cf_module.py.)


instructions:

- Put the data under '042'
- Setup a python3 virtual env and install the following packages:
	* Scipy:  1.5.4
	* Numpy:  1.19.5
	* Pandas 1.1.5
	* Matplotlib:  3.3.4
	* seaborn 0.10.0
	* sklearn: 0.24.1
	* xgboost 1.19.2

For Section1 EDA and Section2 cuisine prediction:
- Start a server and run the notebooks 'section1_EDA.ipynb' and 'section2_Cuisine_prediction.ipynb'
- View the results in the notebook and the generated files in '042'

For section3 collaborative filtering:
- Make sure that section3_CF.py, cf_module.py and the datafile recipes.csv are in the same folder. 
- Run section3_CF.py, who will import functions from cf_module.py.
- The results can be seen by checking the corresponding variable in the environment.

The LaTeX source code is all included in the report folder. The one for the final report is final report.tex, and it's references are stored in progress.bib.
